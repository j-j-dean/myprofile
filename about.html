            <p class="h3 font-bold">History:</p>
            <p class="h4">
                I was born in the small town of Lockport, N.Y.  The town is named for the locks 
                that were built to allow ships to change elevation as they traveled the Erie canal 
                transporting goods from the Great Lakes to NY city.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="h4">
                During my primary school years my father's job moved us to various locations 
                throughout the country: Houston, TX; Philadelphia, PA; and Portsmouth, VA.  I 
                graduated from Churchland High School in Portsmouth, VA and attended the  College 
                of William and Mary where I met the love of my life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="h4">
                After college we obtained employment in central Maryland.  It was a great place 
                to live and work.  I thoroughly enjoyed working on NASA projects for various 
                companies in the space industry.  It was challenging and fulfilling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="h4">
                With our growing family we moved from Maryland closer to family in Richmond, VA 
                where we still live today.  As a part of our move I took on the role as the 
                Stay-At-Home-Dad.  And it has been my joy to serve our family in this way.

            <p class="h3 font-bold">What can I do for your business?</p>
            <p class="h4">
                I have demonstrated through work and volunteer experience that 
                <span class="h3 font-bold">
                    I am able to find quality solutions to critical, time-sensitive problems.
                </span>
                I  worked midnight to 8am shifts to complete work prior to launch delivery on 
                the Gamma Ray Observatory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.  I 
                worked closely with vendors to identify a hardware problem for the Wind/Polar 
                satellite.  As PTA President I worked with the County Council of PTAs and the 
                IRS to return the organization to good standing and correct tax filings.  
                I also worked with officers for the Thomas Dale High School Choral Boosters to 
                obtain 501(c)(3) tax filing status.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="h4">
                Additionally, 
                <span class="h3 font-bold">
                    I am a team leader able to identify and implement creative solutions.
                </span>  
                After a major change to NASA's satellite systems I created and implemented steps 
                to integrate and deliver software working closely with our team and NASA customer.  
                And for several years I have lead a team creating the main staging area backdrop 
                and set providing the visual atmosphere for a summer event at church hosting 250 
                students.
