                        I came on board this project a year before launch of the satellite.  Most
                        of the software to support spacecraft operations were complete.  I learned
                        how to work with a team to correct discrepencies.  I learned about the 
                        software life cycle through experience and through on site training classes.
                        I was responsible for implementing new requirements and updating the
                        corresponding documentation for the user (user's guide and design documents).
                        I was instrumental in developing software to perform limit testing allowing
                        the flight operations team to monitor the health and safety of the spacecraft. 
                        The software was developed in FORTRAN using a Perkin-Elmer main frame computer.  
                        On site at NASA we had removable disc packs that housed the software for various 
                        spacecraft that were scheduled around the clock to make use of limited resources.

                    <p class="h4">
                        This was a great project to work on.  I was given the responsibility to develop
                        the command system software for the satellite control center.  This included
                        verifying the user request and obtaining the related command data from the
                        database using SQL.  I became immersed in learning and understanding the
                        new way to develop the ground system satellite systems using SGI workstations,
                        commercial and in-house common code and developing the software using the 
                        C programming language.  As such, I earned the role as integrator for the 
                        WIND/POLAR task.  WIND and POLAR are two distinct satellites with some very
                        common science tasks being shared between them, so they were developed
                        together.  However, they were delivered separately and the launch of the
                        satellites was about a year apart.  As integrator I was responsible for
                        preparing a delivery solution to our NASA customer that would allow all
                        of the custom software, generic software (between various satellite systems),
                        and commercial software to be packaged for a smooth delivery to our internal
                        test team, the NASA test team, and the flight operations team.  Additionally,
                        I attended requirement, design and code reviews for the custom software, and 
                        the common software.  The entire development life cycle was important to our 
                        company and our NASA client in creating the requested solution.  I also 
                        worked with our team to support data flows with the flight operations team 
                        and the external simulator.  Throughout multiple delivery cycles I was tasked 
                        with determining the cost and effort required to implement new requests.

                       While supporting WIND/POLAR as they approached launch I began working part time
                       on the SOHO satellite system.  After a major change in personnel I was tasked 
                       with integrating this system for delivery to the NASA customer.  I also found
                       solutions to process telemetry data from 9mm tape as required and providing
                       a 1750 floating point conversion utility.  I was responsible for integrating
                       the SOHO software, the generic software, and commercial software for
                       delivery to our NASA customer.  I filled a critical role on this team
                       allowing them to deliver their software release on time.

                    <p class="h4">
                        As a result of performing many DIY projects I have become a little handy at
                        making things with my hands.  Our church began using sponsored curriculm from
                        various organizations to host our summer Vacation Bible School event.  I
                        assisted by being a leader in creating the set and staging for the event.
                        Pictured are a only a few of the items that we have used over the years.
                        I created a portion of the items at home and then delivered them to church.
                        Many of the items created are originals.  I worked with the ministry team
                        to create items that were relevant to our theme (Norway, Thailand, Africa,
                        Weird Animals, Master Fun Factory,...).  I created reusable panels to
                        display a backdrop that has improved efficiency and lowered costs.  As
                        you might imagine there is not a big budget for this activity, so it is
                        imperative to create staging that is relevant to our theme and within budget.
                        As the event approaches my role has needed to be flexible to work with
                        anyone who shows up to help.  This often includes students, youth, parents and
                        even grandparents.  So, it becomes necessary to find jobs that meet the
                        skills of the helper (painting, light carpentry, operating equipment, ladder 
                        work). It is a joy to be a part of this team that is creative and making a 
                        difference in our community.

                        How creative are you?  Well - today it's easier than ever for anyone who
                        wants to be creative to perform an internet search on the topic of your
                        choice and someone probably has a video out there showing you how to do it.
                        About 7 years ago one of my children came home from college for winter
                        break and that was the day the washing machine began leaking everywhere.
                        I don't know about you, but that timing stinks.  I didn't want to pay to
                        have it repaired, so I researched how to do it myself.  After the purchase
                        of a new transmission, a custom tool and following instructions to perform
                        the fix we are back in business.  And FYI it's still working.  Here are
                        just a few other home projects that I have designed and implemented solutions
                        for:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="h5">
                        <li>Replace failing brick porch and railing system
                        <li>Construction of kitty condo for our 2 lovable cats

                        <li>Removed paneling from walls and replaced with dry wall
                        <li>Bath remodeling (new plumbing, fixtures, tile, re-glazing tub)
                    </ul>
                    <p class="h4">
                        It is important to me to help others as well.  I have been on trips with
                        my family, youth and adults to help others.  I did some repairs for families
                        near Washington, NC after Hurrican Florence.  Working with BGAV team I
                        assisted making home repairs for low income people in Southwest Virginia.  
                        And I have been on trips to help others in South Carolina, Atlanta, Pennsylvania 
                        and even locally in the Richmond area.
