                            Over the last year and a half I have invested time learning new technologies.

                        <p class="h4"><strong>Teacher</strong>: I read to my children every day when 
                            they were young. They learned other noneducational things like helping out 
                            around the house through a rotating task schedule, demonstrating good manners 
                            and character traits. They learned there were consequences for both good and 
                            bad actions.   
                        </p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Task Manager</strong>: Planning schedules around nap times 
                            and athletic games/practices.  Coordinating activities to spend time with 
                            family both locally and long distance.  Keeping the pantry stocked, the clothes
                            washed and still finding time to participate as a volunteer in the
                            neighborhood, at school and at church.
                        </p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Accountant</strong>:  Paying the monthly bills.  Saving and 
                            planning fun and engaging activities.  Creating and balancing a budget.  As 
                            you might guess I became a big DIY fan to save money.  I built play ground 
                            equipment, performed home repair (electrical, plumbing, carpentry, windows, 
                            roofing, appliance repair), performed car maintenance (tune-ups, tire changes, 
                            occasional body work and as needed repairs).

                            Transportation to doctor appointments, school, shopping, library, and play 
                            dates.  Daily transportation to and from high school for seasonal sports.
                        </p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Chef</strong>:  Honestly, I don't like to cook.  But 
                            everybody likes to eat.  I performed most of the shopping for meals.  I 
                            prepared lunch daily for all my children during the school years.  It was 
                            important to provide a variety of high quality food to help there bodies 
                            grow and that I knew would be eaten and not wasted.
                        </p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Housekeeper</strong>:  There is no shortage of things to 
                            clean and organize around the house.  This includes vacuuming, laundry, dishes,
                            scrubbing toilets, picking up toys, and cleaning stains.  Of course, there
                            were times that the children assisted as part of learning life skills too.
                        </p>
                        <p class="h4">And...so much more...  This is a very challenging job in so many 
                            ways. I wouldn't change my time in this role for anything.  The reward of
                            helping my children grow and being around during those years has been
                            the greatest blessing I can imagine. I am ever grateful for this experience.

                        to accomplish the task, to develop software in FORTRAN and to perform comprehensive 
                        testing to ensure a quality product.

                    <p class="h4 font-weight-light">On subsequent projects I worked on the WIND/POLAR and 
                        SOHO spacecrafts that were developed on SGI workstations using C and C++. During 
                        those projects I became instrumental in providing guidance and instructions to 
                        providing a smooth integration of all the software and components.  My role was 
                        elevated to lead integrator to provide delivery of those projects to the customer
                        in addition to being responsible for designing/developing software to send commands 
                        to the spacecraft.

                                I have had the privilege to work with students and youth in a fun
                                and engaging atmosphere at our church as a leader and mentor.  This
                                has been an ongoing activity to develop life skills in young people to
                                prepare them as they grow into adulthood.  I have used the ministry
                                provided materials as well as creating my own materials for teaching 
                                students.  This includes using fun activities and games, using videos, 
                                and creating engaging activities to teach the current topic.  Working
                                with a team we have performed plays with students, reached out to serve
                                others locally and regionally, and even collected food to feed
                                the local community.  I am grateful to work with our students.  It is 
                                not always easy.  Sometimes it involves being compassionate during 
                                difficult family times or adjusting to behaviors that need some 
                                redirection.  It is very rewarding to me and the students that we 
                                work with.

                                This has been a great opportunity for me to assist in the development
                                of students to learn the game of basketball and life.  As referees in
                                this league we also act as coaches on the court.  Sometimes an 
                                encouraging word can help a developing athlete make the right play.
                                Additionally, we are there to make the tough calls.  As you can
                                imagine not everybody is happy when they get called for a foul or
                                violation.  I have learned to accept the criticism.  It's part of the
                                game, and I recognize that I make mistakes too.  As I have done this
                                for a number of years I have had the opportunity on many occasions
                                to assist both youth and adults in learning how to be referees as well.

                                I thought this role was going to be a piece of cake.  I spoke with the
                                outgoing treasurer about her role, and found the organization was
                                operating on a $30K budget.  However, in the two years I was there
                                it quickly escalated to $100K after a change in directors and 
                                administration.  There were trips planned to New York City, Disney 
                                World, and Indiana.  The school required the organization to become 
                                a 501(c)(3) which entailed lots of financial tax preparation and 
                                federal application completion. I was also responsible for a NEW online 
                                tool to communicate with parents and students related to finances, 
                                costumes, trips and more. The board adopted using Google Docs for 
                                communication.  And we organized the first show choir competition at 
                                Thomas Dale HS as well as providing an informative website to share 
                                the accomplishments of the choirs at the school.  There were also many 
                                fund raisers to prepare and administer including: donut sales, flower 
                                sales, a car show, a gift card program, and seasonal choir events.  This
                                role was very rewarding and a great opportunity to serve the community.

                                This originally seemed like an overwhelming role to me with many
                                moving parts that needed to be performed simultaneously.  I attended
                                county wide training to assist in being productive in this role.  I
                                quickly learned this was a business.  There were IRS and local regulations
                                that had to be completed accurately and on time.  Many business
                                partnerships were needed to support financial plans, community outreach,
                                and student related activities.  I received tremendous support from
                                the school and community to correct some problems from the previous
                                administration.  This was also a great opportunity to interact with the
                                students and school through monthly meetings and activities, dining out
                                nights, skate nights and other stimulating activities to support the
                                goal of educating our students.  I created, copied and distributed a
                                monthly newsletter to a 700 student body to inform and educate the
                                school community.  I created the first color yearbook at the school
                                through the usage of our partner's online yearbook creation tool.  I
                                worked with a team of parents to perform fund raising events to provide
                                educational workshops and materials for the school.  I was able to 
                                help meet the needs of the school and community through communication
                                and serving in this role.
