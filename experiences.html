                        <h3><strong>Teacher</strong>: I read to my children every day when they were young.
                            They learned other noneducational things like helping out around the house 
                            through a rotating task schedule, demonstrating good manners and character 
                            traits. They learned there were consequences for both good and bad actions.   
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Task Manager</strong>: Planning schedules around nap times and
                            athletic games/practices.  Coordinating activities to spend time with family
                            both locally and long distance.  Keeping the pantry stocked, the clothes
                            washed and still finding time to participate as a volunteer in the
                            neighborhood, schools and at church.
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Accountant</strong>:  Paying the monthly bills.  Saving and planning
                            fun and engaging activities.  Creating and balancing a budget.  As you might
                            guess I became a big DIY fan to save money.  I built play ground equipment,
                            performed home repair (electrical, plumbing, carpentry, windows, roofing, 
                            appliance repair), performed car maintenance (tune-ups, tire changes, 
                            occasional body work and as needed repairs).
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Chauffeur</strong>:  Travel to sports games and practices and 
                            participated in car pools to out of town clinics and tournaments.  Transportation
                            to doctor appointments, school, shopping, library, and play dates.  Daily
                            transportation to and from high school during sport seasons.
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Chef</strong>:  Honestly, I don't like to cook.  But everybody likes
                            to eat.  I performed most of the shopping for meals.  I prepared lunch
                            daily for all my children prior and during school years.  It was important
                            to provide a variety of high quality food to help there bodies grow and
                            that I knew would be eaten and not wasted.
                        </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Housekeeper</strong>:  There is no shortage of things to clean and
                            organize around the house.  This includes vacuuming, laundry, dishes,
                            scrubbing toilets, picking up toys, and cleaning stains.  Of course, there
                            were times that the children assisted as part of learning life skills too.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>And...so much more...  This is a very challenging job in so many ways.
                            I wouldn't change my time in this role for anything.  The reward of
                            helping my children grow and being around during those years has been
                            the greatest blessing I can imagine. I am ever grateful for this experience.

                        there to study our galaxy and beyond.  How cool is that?  I grew in my role here.
